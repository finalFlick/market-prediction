# Epic: Deployment, Security, and CI

## Status

Proposed

## Summary

Package and validate the platform for self-hosted Unraid operation with secure secrets, containers, CI gates, and recovery paths.

## Why This Matters

This epic supports the platform goal of learning to make money over time while preserving deterministic evidence, non-bypassable risk, and operator trust. It groups work that should be planned and reviewed as one platform capability.

## Goals

- Represent the relevant requirements as reviewable feature tickets.
- Preserve the architecture and safety boundaries in design.md.
- Make validation expectations visible before implementation starts.

## Non-Goals

- Write implementation code.
- Replace requirements.md or design.md as the source of truth.
- Weaken the one-way pipeline, LLM isolation, or risk gate.

## Scope

### Included

- Feature tickets listed below.
- Traceability to requirements and design sections.
- Risks, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and validation expectations.

### Excluded

- Implementation file plans not already required by the design.
- Live-capital promotion unless explicitly covered by a gated feature.
- New trading-signal hypotheses, which follow the SIGNALS.md research workflow.

## Source Traceability

- requirements.md: Req 37, 38, 39, 40, 46, 51
- design.md: Deployment and Operations, Security Considerations, Testing Strategy, Final Architecture Recommendation
- Repo standards: .cursor/rules/architecture.mdc, .cursor/rules/security.mdc, .cursor/rules/workflow.mdc, .cursor/rules/spec-sessions.mdc, and AGENTS.md.

## Features

- [ ] [FEATURE-0038 - Docker and Unraid Deployment Topology](./docker_unraid_topology_0038.md)
- [ ] [FEATURE-0039 - CI/CD and Quality Gates](./cicd_quality_gates_0039.md)
- [ ] [FEATURE-0040 - Secrets and Security Controls](./secrets_security_controls_0040.md)

## Dependencies

- Approved requirements.md and design.md.
- Existing repo architecture and package boundaries.
- Verification workflow from .cursor/rules/workflow.mdc.

## Risks and Constraints

- Scope can drift if later-phase items are treated as MVP-0 blockers.
- Tickets must remain product/spec artifacts rather than disguised implementation checklists.
- Any order-producing capability must preserve Strategy.target_positions -> RiskEngine.check_and_size -> Broker.place_order.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every feature in this epic has a parent epic, source traceability, acceptance criteria, validation expectations, dependencies, risks, observability, documentation, and done criteria.
- The epic can be used to sequence implementation without requiring code-level prescriptions.
- The epic does not contradict requirements.md, design.md, or Cursor rules.

## Validation Expectations

- Review links and paths in this epic and its feature tickets.
- Use ReadLints for edited Markdown.
- During implementation, run the relevant tests plus pytest -q, ruff check ., and mypy --strict . unless a task-specific waiver is recorded.

## Notes

Implementation agents should pick feature tickets rather than this epic directly. If implementation reveals a gap in requirements or design, update those source documents before changing code.
