# FEATURE-0009: Run Memory and Artifact Replay

## Parent Epic

run-engine-memory

## Status

Proposed

## Summary

Define per-run, experiment, and global memory plus artifact replay expectations for future analysis.

## Why

The platform needs to learn over time without hidden mutable state.

## What

A memory capability for summaries, decisions, inputs, outputs, replay handles, and scope boundaries.

## User / System Story

As a platform operator or implementation agent,
I want run memory and artifact replay,
so that the trading-lab platform can satisfy the related requirements with evidence.

## Source Traceability

- requirements.md: Req 8, 12, 26, 42
- design.md: Component 4; Canonical Artifact Folder; Compliance and Auditability
- Repo conventions: .cursor/rules/architecture.mdc, .cursor/rules/security.mdc, .cursor/rules/workflow.mdc, .cursor/rules/spec-sessions.mdc, and AGENTS.md.

## Requirements Covered

- Req 8
- Req 12
- Req 26
- Req 42

## Design Alignment

Component 4; Canonical Artifact Folder; Compliance and Auditability. This feature states the expected capability and review evidence without prescribing code-level implementation details beyond the design and project rules.

## In Scope

- The behavior, outcome, or platform capability described above.
- Traceability to listed requirements and design sections.
- Validation expectations appropriate to the affected pipeline stage.
- Documentation and diagnostics needed for review and operation.

## Out of Scope

- Implementation code.
- Exact file-level steps unless already mandated by design.md.
- Later-phase capabilities not listed in the source traceability.
- Any change that bypasses risk, weakens LLM isolation, or breaks the one-way pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given the source documents and repo standards, when an implementation plan is prepared, then it traces this feature to the listed requirements and design sections.
- Given the feature is implemented, when validation runs, then the expected tests and checks listed below pass with command/result evidence.
- Given unsupported or later-phase behavior is requested, when the system handles it, then it rejects, defers, or marks it explicitly rather than silently enabling it.

## Validation Expectations

- artifact manifest checks; replay smoke tests; memory-scope tests
- Stage-appropriate unit, integration, contract, e2e, safety, or smoke tests.
- Final implementation evidence should include pytest -q, ruff check ., and mypy --strict . unless the approved task narrows verification with a documented reason.

## Dependencies

- run lifecycle; artifact schema; audit log

## Risks / Edge Cases

- Global memory can become a hidden source of nondeterminism.
- Phase boundaries must remain visible in implementation and docs.
- Reviewers must confirm validation evidence is real, not aspirational.

## Observability / Diagnostics

The implementation should expose enough logs, metrics, audit records, UI state, or artifact metadata for an operator or reviewer to determine whether the feature is active, healthy, degraded, rejected, or deferred. Diagnostics must avoid logging secrets and preserve the auditability expectations in design.md.

## Documentation Expectations

- Update operator or developer documentation when the feature changes a workflow, command, route, config surface, or safety policy.
- Update DECISIONS.md if implementation changes architecture, risk posture, phase scope, or release gates.
- Update SESSION_LOG.md with verification evidence when implementation work lands.

## Done Means

- [ ] The feature outcome is implemented or explicitly marked as deferred according to its phase.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria above are satisfied with evidence.
- [ ] Validation expectations are covered by tests, smoke checks, or documented manual verification.
- [ ] Source traceability remains accurate after implementation.
- [ ] Required docs, decisions, and session log entries are updated.
